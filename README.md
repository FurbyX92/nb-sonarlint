# nb-sonarlint
A SonarLint plugin for Netbeans

It runs SonarLint in connected mode  when a file (java files at the moment) is saved and it shows the issues as editor annotations.

The SonarQube server url can be set in **Tools > Options > Miscellaneous > SonarQube**. Default url is http://localhost:9000.

SonarLint can be enabled or disabled per project in **Properties > SonarLint**. A list of excluded files can also be defined in this section.
